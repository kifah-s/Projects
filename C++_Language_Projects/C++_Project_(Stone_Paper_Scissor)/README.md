# Stone Paper Scissor ..

## The Rock – Paper – Scissors game in C++ is a simple entertainment program where the player competes against the computer. The player chooses one option (rock, paper, or scissors), while the computer makes a random choice. The program then compares both choices to determine the winner according to the well-known rules: rock beats scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. Finally, the program displays the result of the round along with the choices made by both the player and the computer.
